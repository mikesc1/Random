# Random
Random of assortment of personal projects and homework assignments in Python and R for my buddies to look at for reference.

Files are uploaded in no particular order and I may or may not upload the supporting files (xlsx,csv,jpgs, etc...) for them to run. If you find something that needs a supporting file and would like me to look a little harder for it on my hard drive let me know and I may attempt.

I do refer back to my old projects and assignments often for reeducational purposes so feel free to modify them in another branch and let me know how they could be improved. Be aware that I was first introduced to coding of any sort in an upper division computational physics course and on the first day of class asked the professor, "Why are we talking about all these animals (python, anaconda, spyder, pandas) in a computer class?" in front of a lecture hall of computer/data science majors (myself being a physics major). All this to say that many of my early projects are likely to be hot trash.
